# scHetG

![overview](/overview.png "overview")

scHetG is a structure-preserved scRNA-seq data integration approach using heterogeneous graph neural network. By establishing a heterogeneous graph that represents the interactions between multiple batches of cells and genes, and combining a heterogeneous graph neural network with contrastive learning, scHetG concurrently obtained cell and gene embeddings with structural information.

scHetG is implemented in Python 3.9, the code execution adheres to the subsequent steps:

1.```python scHetG.py```

Prior to execution, it is necessary to set either ```common_genes = True``` or ```common_genes = False``` to integrate datasets that possess common or distinct genes in different batches. 

The output adata contains the cell embeddings in ```adata.obsm['feat']``` and the gene embeddings in ```adata.varm['feat']```. The embeddings can be used as input of other downstream analyses.

2.```python scHetG/co_expression/gene_co_expression_human_lung.py```

This step obtains the gene embedding image and calculates the ratio between inter-cell-type similarity and intra-cell-type similarity.
